      Signatories is a simple web-based program that allows a person to sign
      an online petition, a declaration, a statement, or any form of communication
      that requires community support. Designed for academics, signing is accomplished
      by authenticating with an account at <a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Campaigns can choose to allow for anonymous signatures or not. Signatories
      to a campaign may choose to add their professional affiliation, and they can modify their
      preferences or remove their signature after signing. When the signatory's
      name is visible, any user may click on it to inspect their ORCID profile.
      </p>
      <p>
      By requiring an account at ORCID to sign, not only are bogus signatures
      avoided, but this helps to limit participants to the academic community. An
      ORCID account may sign at most once, and anonymous participants are assured to
      have an ORCID account.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you would like to create a campaign, please provide the
      <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}">site administrator</a> with your
      ORCID iD. They will give you access to editor controls that will allow you
      to create campaigns, or to modify, delete or close campaigns for which you
      are the owner.
