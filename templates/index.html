      Signatories is a simple web-based program that allows a person to sign
      an online petition, a declaration, a statement, or any form of communication
      that requires community support. Designed for academics, signing is accomplished
      by authenticating with an Open Researcher and Contributor ID account (<a href="https://orcid.org" target="_blank">ORCID</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
      Campaigns can choose to allow for anonymous signatures or not. Signatories
      to a campaign may choose to add their professional affiliation, and they can modify their
      preferences or remove their signature after signing. When the signatory's
      name is visible, any public visitor may click on it to inspect their ORCID profile.
      </p>
      <p>
      By requiring an account at ORCID to sign, not only are bogus signatures
      avoided, but this helps to limit participants to the academic community. An
      ORCID account may sign at most once, and anonymous participants are assured to
      have an ORCID account.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you would like to create a campaign, please contact the
      <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}">site administrator</a> and provide your
      ORCID. They will give you access to editor controls that will allow you
      to create campaigns and modify, delete or close those campaigns for which you
      are the owner.
